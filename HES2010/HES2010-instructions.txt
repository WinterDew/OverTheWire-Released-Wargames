--- OverTheWire's HES2010 wargame, released January 2012 --- 

1. Introduction

This wargame revolves around a company called Dirty-Underwear.com which buys and sells dirty 
underwear. Your job, very simply, is to break into the server and beat all levels.
Hint: the credentials for the first level can be found by going through the local 
website. Think like Google!

2. How to play ?

First, download the diskimage because it is intended to run locally.
Import the diskimage into your favorite virtualization software. The game is based on Ubuntu, 
so any virtual hardware supported by Ubuntu should be fine in your virtualization environment.

When booted, the VM configures its network interface with:
   IP 192.168.66.66/24
   gateway 192.168.66.254
   DNS server 8.8.8.8 (Google)
There is no need to give access to the internet to get this VM working.

You can use SSH to login to the VM. For maintenance reasons, there is an account 'otw' with 
password 'otw' with sudo rights to get a root account. This maintenance account is not part of
the wargame and should not be used when playing the wargame fairly.
